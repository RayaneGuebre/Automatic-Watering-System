# Automatic Watering System

## Total time spent: 17h
Hey, guess who forgot to make the repository for this project? Me! And here I am. 
Dear highway reviewer, please have some mercy :D
Most of the time spent each day has been estimated based on my memory and skills
## Plan
Using an ESP32 to control a water pump to automatically water some plants daily

## Features
- Use rainwater to reduce water waste
- using a potentiometer to regulate the amount of water pumped

I forgot to log my progress, but better late than never, I guess :)
I've almost finished the schematic, but I don't know how to assign the footprint to a custom symbol I made to solder the power source directly to the PCB
Designing: 1h

Since no one on Slack checked my pcb schematic and i don't trust chatgpt, i ended up in a Discord server focused on electronic engineering, and there I received a lot of help and tips, and got my schematic checked and approved!!
Researching: 2h

22:44 update:
I've finished the schematic, but I'm unsure if it'll work. Hoping someone can check it for me
At the end, I didn't solder the power source wire directly to the PCB, but I used a terminal block so I don't have to resolder it in case of need.

After a short pause, I've completed the PCB and the code. I just need to finish the BOM, and it will be ready to ship!!!
I'm gonna order most parts from digiKey, even if at first I wanted to use Mouser, but I changed because Mouser didn't have the solder i was looking for
Designing, coding and researching: 3h

After a month of exams and then getting sick, I decided to finally finish the BOM, BUT I forgot that the file of the PCB was on my school laptop. Even if  I thought I saved it on my OneDrive (spoiler: I didn't save it correctly). After giving it back and checking on OneDrive, I discovered that it all went gone, except the PNG file that I committed here on GitHub ( thanks God ), and so after 3 days of rage baiting, I finally finished it (my personal laptop is slow as hell). Tomorrow I'm going to complete the BOM and ship it to Highway!!!
The most difficult parts were most probably the schematic, since I KICAD kept crashing, but I made it through.
Designing: 3 / 4h

So i tought that everything was ready to be submitted to highway, but while checking the BOM i realized that using digikey, i would have to pay customs as well, so i decided to switch to Mouser, but the only problem is that the potentiometer i found on digikey is not available on Mouser, so tomorrow i've to change that component on the pcb design, but now it's 1 Am so i should go to sleep, good night dear reader. 
Changing supplier and BOM: 2h

Now, everything is ready. I rechecked the BOM, and everything is in USD, and the PCB and schematics are ready as well.

Today I've added a case and also made some changes in the BOM to reduce the costs, since the solder was too expensive, but I saved some money on the VAT, though. Now I'm ready to reship!!!

#28 / 07

I lost the Fusion 360 file for the case, so I couldn't separate the two parts for separate printing. As a result, I had to recreate the design. Fortunately, I still had the dimensions from the STL file that I uploaded to GitHub.b.
