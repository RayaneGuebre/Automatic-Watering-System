# Automatic Watering System
Hey, guess who forgot to make the repository for this project? me! And here I am. 

## Plan
Using an ESP32 to control a water pump to automatically water some plants daily

## Features
- Use rainwater to reduce water waste
- Create a QR code to manually water the plants when needed
- using a potentiometer to regulate the amount of water pumped

I forgot to log my progress, but better late than never, I guess :)
I've almost finished the schematic, but I don't know how to assign the footprint to a custom symbol I made to solder the power source directly to the PCB

22:44 update:
I've finished the schematic, but I'm unsure if it'll work. Hoping someone can check it for me
