# Automatic Watering System
Hey, guess who forgot to make the repository for this project? me! And here I am. 

## Plan
Using an ESP32 to control a water pump to automatically water some plants daily

## Features
- Use rainwater to reduce water waste
- Create a QR code to manually water the plants when needed
- using a potentiometer to regulate the amount of water pumped

I forgot to log my progress, but better late than never, I guess :)
I've almost finished the schematic, but I don't know how to assign the footprint to a custom symbol I made to solder the power source directly to the PCB

22:44 update:
I've finished the schematic, but I'm unsure if it'll work. Hoping someone can check it for me

after a short pause i've completed the PCB and the code, i just need to finish the BOM ad it will be ready to ship!!!

## 11/07
After a month of exams and then getting sick i decided to finally finish the BOM, BUT, i forgot that the file of the pcb was on my school laptop and i thought i saved it on my Onedrive (spoiler: I didn't save it correctly) but after giving it back and checking on Onedrive, i discovered that it all went gone, except the png file that i commited here on github ( thanks God ) and so after 3 days of rage baiting i finally finished it (my personal laptop is slow as hell). Tomorrow I'm going to complete the BOM and ship it to Highway!!!
