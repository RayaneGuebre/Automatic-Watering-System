# Automatic Watering System

## Total time spent: 13H 30min
Hey, guess who forgot to make the repository for this project? me! And here I am. 
Dear highway reviewer, please have some mercy :D
Most of the time spent each day has been supposed based on my memory and skills
## Plan
Using an ESP32 to control a water pump to automatically water some plants daily

## Features
- Use rainwater to reduce water waste
- using a potentiometer to regulate the amount of water pumped

I forgot to log my progress, but better late than never, I guess :)
I've almost finished the schematic, but I don't know how to assign the footprint to a custom symbol I made to solder the power source directly to the PCB
Designign: 1h

22:44 update:
I've finished the schematic, but I'm unsure if it'll work. Hoping someone can check it for me
Designing: 30m

## 07/06
after a short pause, I've completed the PCB and the code. i just need to finish the BOM ad it will be ready to ship!!!
Designign and research: 2h


## 11/07
After a month of exams and then getting sick i decided to finally finish the BOM, BUT, i forgot that the file of the pcb was on my school laptop. I thought i saved it on my Onedrive (spoiler: I didn't save it correctly). Still, after giving it back and checking on Onedrive, i discovered that it all went gone, except the png file that i commited here on github ( thanks God ) and so after 3 days of rage baiting i finally finished it (my personal laptop is slow as hell). Tomorrow I'm going to complete the BOM and ship it to Highway!!!

Designing: 3 / 4h

## 20 / 07
So i tought that everything was ready to be submitted to highway, but while checking the BOM i realized that using digikey, i would have to pay customs as well, so i decided to switch to Mouser, but the only problem is that the potentiometer i found on digikey is not available on Mouser, so tomorrow i've to change that component on the pcb design, but now it's 1 Am so i should go to sleep, good night dear reader 
Changing supplier and BOM: 2h


## 21/07
Now, everything is ready.
Pcb design, Bom, writing: 5h
